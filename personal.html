                                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife">Recife</a>.
                                                It is very hot and humid all year, with a slightly less hot rainy season.
                                                <br>
                                                It is one of the main capitals of Brazil's northeast region.
                                                If you ever visit, make sure you eat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolo_de_rolo"><i>bolo de rolo</i></a>,

                                                Brazil is not the easiest country to live in, and so being born and raised here, 
                                                I had to learn to be resilient (and a little bit pessimistic).
                                                I also learned that I strongly believed in being kind to others, and helping others, 
                                                and to me this is an act of resistance.
                                            </p><p>
                                                I believe in collaboration, 
                                                and that we should strive to build inclusive and accepting communities.
                                                I aim to be able to give back to the communities I am part of, even though I'm often not sure of how to do this.

                                                I love having pets, and I have had many of them in my life.
                                                I have had mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, and a rabbit.
                                                I have also had many dogs. My first two dogs have sadly passed away, and I will always miss them.

                                                In my Canadian home (where I currently live), I have two terribly cute guinea pigs.
                                                <br>
                                                In my Brazilian home, I have two tortoises and two dogs: 
                                                a very sweet german shepherd and a loving rescue mutt.
                                                <br>
                                                I also like cats, but never had the chance to have one.

                                                Besides dogs and pets, I enjoy reading books (both fiction and non-fiction), watching shows, 
                                                doing arts and crafts, and eating chocolate.
