											<h2>Who I am</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											I am a brazilian <strong>Software Engineer</strong>,
											mostly interested in Programming Languages, Type Theory, and Mathematics overall.
											<br>
											My career goal is to improve the way people read, write and modify computer programs.

										<h2>Formal education</h2>
										<p>
											I graduated in December 2020 with a <strong>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering</strong> from the
											<a href="https://www.ufpe.br/">Federal University of Pernambuco</a>, Brazil.
										</p>

										<h2>Honors (Undergraduate) Thesis</h2>
										<p>
											During my last semester, <strong>I did research on how to check if automated refactorings preserve program behavior.
											To address this problem, I decided to adopt a testing approach, and to focus on
											<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> refactorings.</strong>
											<br>
											To test a refactoring, we need a test input, in this case a program, and a test oracle.
											The idea behind my research project is to <strong>test refactorings by automatically generating programs 
											that can be used as test inputs.</strong>
											And, as a proxy for behavior preservation,
											<stong>I used the TypeScript compiler as a test oracle,</stong>
											checking if the input programs that were compilable still remained compilable after refactoring.
											<br>
											I implemented this technique in a tool called
											<a href="https://github.com/gabritto/tsdolly">TSDolly</a>.
    										Using TSDolly, I was able to find and report 
											<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/40994">one bug</a> in a TypeScript refactoring.
											<br>
											My advisor was <a href="https://cin.ufpe.br/~lmt/">Leopoldo Motta Teixeira</a>,
											and the technique used in TSDolly was an adaptation of the one presented in
											<a href="https://github.com/gustavoasoares/jdolly">JDolly</a>.
											My thesis can be 
											<a href="https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~tg/2020-3/TG_EC/tg_gab.pdf">found here</a> (in English, abstract also in Portuguese).

										<h2>Teaching Assistant</h2>
										<p>
											<strong>I was a teaching assistant for a total of 5 semesters,</strong> for the courses of
											Discrete Mathematics (2 semesters), Algorithms and Data Structures (2 semesters),
											and Paradigms of Computational Languages (1 semester).
											<br>
											During that time, I taught extra classes, answered students' questions,
											and came up with some extra assignments for the students to practice and learn.
											I really enjoyed this experience of helping other students and giving back by sharing what I learned.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h2>Competitive Programming</h2>
										<p>
											<strong>I was a member of the competitive programming team of my University between 2016 and 2017.</strong>
											I competed in official ACM ICPC competitions at the sub-regional and regional level.
											<br>
											I mostly enjoyed this experience for the chance to discuss algorithms and data structures with other students,
											and for the chance to work in a team (of 3) to solve the programming problems.

								<h2>Internships</h2>
								<p>
									While I was a student, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern several times:
								</p>

									<li>
										<h2>TypeScript Compiler, Microsoft</h2>
										<p>
											<span class="icon fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></span> December 2019 - March 2020
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>I worked on improving <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/dts-critic">dts-critic</a>,
											a tool that checks the compatibility between a
											TypeScript declaration file (a declarations-only file declaring variables, functions etc, and their types)
											and a JavaScript library.</strong>
											<br>I contributed additional checks for some of JavaScript's many ways to specify modules,
											and their corresponding declaration pattern in TypeScript.
											<br>dts-critic is used on the 
											<a>DefinitelyTyped</a> repository, an open source collection of TypeScript declarations for JavaScript libraries,
											written by the TypeScript community.
											The tool runs as a part of the tests that are executed for every contribution to DefinitelyTyped,
											aiming to improve the quality of contributed declarations.
										</p>

										<h2>TypeScript Compiler, Microsoft</h2>
										<p>
											<span class="icon fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></span> January 2019 - March 2019
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>I developed a 
											<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/30089">TypeScript refactoring</a> for emulating the 
											<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_parameter">named parameters</a> language feature</strong>
											(also known as named arguments or keyword arguments).
											<br>
											JavaScript, and therefore TypeScript, does not provide builtin support for named parameters.
											A way to emulate this feature is to use an object as a function's parameter,
											where each of the object's properties is a named/keyword parameter.
											Then, the function can be called with an object argument, where each property of this argument object corresponds to a named (keyword) argument.
										</p>
										An illustrative example is that this refactoring would convert the code
										<div class="content">
											<pre>
												<code>function getName(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
	return firstName + " " + lastName;
}
getName("Barbara", "Liskov");</code>
											</pre>
										</div>
										into
										<div class="content">
											<pre>
												<code>function getName({ firstName: string, lastName: string }) {
	return firstName + " " + lastName;
}
getName({ firstName: "Barbara", lastName: "Liskov" });</code>
											</pre>
										</div>
										</p>

										<h2>Test Infrastructure, Facebook</h2>
										<p>
											<span class="icon fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></span> September 2019 - November 2019
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>I implemented a concurrent caching service in Rust.</strong>
											The service was part of the internal test infrastructure.
											<br>
											<strong>The main purpose of my internship was to 
											assess the viability of implementing testing infrastructure services in Rust.</strong>
											Before my internship, no one on the team had used Rust.
											<br>
											At the end of my internship, I reported on the state of the Rust ecosystem,
											including the state of Rust's async/away features (on alpha at the time of my internship),
											libraries, and Rust tooling.
											I also reported on the state of internal Rust libraries,
											what was already done and what still had to be improved before the team would adopt Rust.

										<h2>Abuse Fighting Infrastructure, Google</h2>
										<p>
											<span class="icon fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></span> April 2019 - July 2019
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>I reimplemented and helped redesign a service from Google's internal abuse fighting infrastructure.</strong>
											The service was originally written in Python, and I reimplemented the redesigned version in Go,
											resulting in a considerable efficiency gain.
										</p>
									</li>

										<h2>Reusable Components at Bing, Microsoft</h2>
										<p>
											<span class="icon fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></span> December 2017 - February 2018
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>I developed a front-end component used to display websites as an overlay on Bing's search results page.</strong>
											The component displayed <a href="https://amp.dev/">AMP pages</a> to allow for fast loading times,
											and it was displayed over the search results page to allow for easier navigation between different result pages.
											The component was developed using C#, CSS, and TypeScript.

									Proof Assistants (mostly <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a>, 
									a tiny bit of <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/what-is-agda.html">Agda</a>), 
									Functional Programming,
									<a href="https://alloytools.org/">Alloy</a> (a modeling language and model finder),
