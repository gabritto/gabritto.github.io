										<h2> Research: TSDolly </h2>
										<div class="txt">
											<p>
												For my undergraduate thesis, I was motivated by an <a>internship experience</a>
												to try and improve the quality of TypeScript automated refactorings.
												Advised by <a href="https://cin.ufpe.br/~lmt/">Leopoldo Motta Teixeira</a>,
												I researched how to test tools that modify TypeScript programs.
											</p><p>
												The result was <a href="https://github.com/gabritto/tsdolly">TSDolly</a>, a tool that generates TypeScript programs
												which can be used as test inputs for testing tools.
												The programs TSDolly generates satisfy preconditions imposed by the tools under test:
												for example, to be able to test a refactoring that modifies a class,
												we need to make sure the generated test input program actually has a class declaration.
											</p><p>
												TSDolly implements a technique that allows for generating programs that satisfy user-specified preconditions.
												This technique was adapted from <a href="https://github.com/gustavoasoares/jdolly">previous work</a>
												focused on generating Java programs suitable for testing Java automated refactorings.
												<br>
												To demonstrate the use of TSDolly, I used it to test some TypeScript refactorings.
												Testing these refactorings by applying them to the TSDolly generated programs,
												I was able to find and report a
												<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/40994">bug</a> in a TypeScript refactoring.
											</p><p>
												My thesis can be found
												<a href="https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~tg/2020-3/TG_EC/tg_gab.pdf">here</a> (in English, abstract also in Portuguese).
												<br>
												As a result of this undergraduate thesis work,
												<a href="https://cin.ufpe.br/~lmt/">my advisor Leopoldo</a>, <a href="http://www.dsc.ufcg.edu.br/~rohit/">Rohit Gheyi</a>
												and I wrote a paper to be published in the
												<a href="http://cbsoft2021.joinville.udesc.br/sblp.php">25th Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages (SBLP'21)</a>.
												A <strong>preprint</strong> can be found <a href="images/SBLP_2021_TSDolly_AuthorVersion.pdf">here</a> (in English).

											During my last semester, <strong>I did research on how to check if automated refactorings preserve program behavior.
											To address this problem, I decided to adopt a testing approach, and to focus on
											<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> refactorings.</strong>
											<br>
											To test a refactoring, we need a test input, in this case a program, and a test oracle.
											The idea behind my research project is to <strong>test refactorings by automatically generating programs 
											that can be used as test inputs.</strong>
											And, as a proxy for behavior preservation,
											<stong>I used the TypeScript compiler as a test oracle,</stong>
											checking if the input programs that were compilable still remained compilable after refactoring.
											<br>
											I implemented this technique in a tool called
											<a href="https://github.com/gabritto/tsdolly">TSDolly</a>.
    										Using TSDolly, I was able to find and report 
											<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/40994">one bug</a> in a TypeScript refactoring.
											<br>
											My advisor was <a href="https://cin.ufpe.br/~lmt/">Leopoldo Motta Teixeira</a>,
											and the technique used in TSDolly was an adaptation of the one presented in
											<a href="https://github.com/gustavoasoares/jdolly">JDolly</a>.
											My thesis can be 
											<a href="https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~tg/2020-3/TG_EC/tg_gab.pdf">found here</a> (in English, abstract also in Portuguese).

										<h2>Teaching Assistant</h2>
										<div class="txt">
											<p>
												<strong>I was a teaching assistant for a total of 5 semesters,</strong> for the courses of
												Discrete Mathematics (2 semesters), Algorithms and Data Structures (2 semesters),
												and Paradigms of Computational Languages (1 semester).
												<br>
												During that time, I taught extra classes, answered students' questions,
												and came up with some extra assignments for the students to practice and learn.
												I really enjoyed this experience of helping other students and giving back by sharing what I learned.

												<strong>I worked on improving <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/dts-critic">dts-critic</a>,
												a tool that checks the compatibility between a
												TypeScript declaration file (a declarations-only file declaring variables, functions etc, and their types)
												and a JavaScript library.</strong>
												<br>
												I contributed additional checks for some of JavaScript's many ways to specify modules,
												and their corresponding declaration pattern in TypeScript.
												<br>
												dts-critic is used on the 
												<a>DefinitelyTyped</a> repository, an open source collection of TypeScript declarations for JavaScript libraries,
												written by the TypeScript community.
												The tool runs as a part of the tests that are executed for every contribution to DefinitelyTyped,
												aiming to improve the quality of contributed declarations.

												<strong>I developed a 
												<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/30089">TypeScript refactoring</a> for emulating the 
												<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_parameter">named parameters</a> language feature</strong>
												(also known as named arguments or keyword arguments).
												<br>
												JavaScript, and therefore TypeScript, does not provide builtin support for named parameters.
												A way to emulate this feature is to use an object as a function's parameter,
												where each of the object's properties is a named/keyword parameter.
												Then, the function can be called with an object argument, where each property of this argument object corresponds to a named (keyword) argument.
											</p>
											An illustrative example is that this refactoring would convert the code
											<div class="content">
												<pre>
													<code>function getName(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
		return firstName + " " + lastName;
	}
	getName("Barbara", "Liskov");</code>
												</pre>
											</div>

												<strong>I implemented a concurrent caching service in Rust.</strong>
												The service was part of the internal test infrastructure.
												<br>
												<strong>The main purpose of my internship was to 
												assess the viability of implementing testing infrastructure services in Rust.</strong>
												Before my internship, no one on the team had used Rust.
												<br>
												At the end of my internship, I reported on the state of the Rust ecosystem,
												including the state of Rust's async/away features (on alpha at the time of my internship),
												libraries, and Rust tooling.
												I also reported on the state of internal Rust libraries,
												what was already done and what still had to be improved before the team would adopt Rust.
